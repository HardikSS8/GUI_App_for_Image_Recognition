# Image_Recognition_GUI
This repository is the GUI application built in Python using the Tkinter library which can used to display the label of the user given image as input in application.

## Requirements

1. Keras
2. TensorFlow
3. TKinter
4. PyCharm

## Project Description

-> This application uses a deep neural-network model developed using the keras framework. Here I have used the CIFAR-10 dataset which consists of 60,000 images (50, 000 for training purpose and 10,000 for test purpose) which can be classified into ten classes.

-> This model can be expressed as multi-class classification model because we are classifying images into more than two classes.

-> This classes are as follows. 
   1. Airplane
   2. Automobile
   3. Bird
   4. Cat
   5. Deer
   6. Dog
   7. Frog
   8. Horse
   9. Ship
   10. Truck

-> This dataset can be download at here. [https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) or we can import the dataset using the import command from the keras.datasets

1. Keras is the built-in framework in Python used to develop the deep learning neural-network with the few lines of programming.
2. TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for dataflow across a neural-network nodes.

## Getting Setup

1. Download PyCharm: [https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download)

2. Install the Keras and Tensorflow library by using the following commands in the Terminal.
      
        pip install keras
        
        pip install tensorflow

3. Similarly we can add other libraries like numpy,pathlib using the following commands.
        
        pip install numpy
         
        pip install pathlib
  
4. Clone or download this repository <br/>
